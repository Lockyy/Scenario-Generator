You can add a new game by adding it to config/initializers/games/
Right now there is no guide to how to add a game unfortunately. The existing games are fairly self-explanatory however.
Any games added will automatically appear in the Index and Sidebar.

Pull requests will be vetted for spelling and grammar. Feel free to correct me if I've messed either up.
