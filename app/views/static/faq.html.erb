        What is Scenario Generator?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        Scenario Generator is a site I created for generating randomized characters, playthroughs, and scenarios for various games including Skyrim, Minecraft, and Crusader Kings 2. The site allows you to try games in ways you otherwise wouldn't and to challenge yourself to something new.

      <div class="col-xs-12 question">Why did you build Scenario Generator?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        Scenario Generator was originally built as just a challenge generator for Dwarf Fortress. It gave you a location, challenge and a restriction to make things harder. The site sat inactive at <%= link_to 'dwarf-fortress-scenario-picker.herokuapp.com', 'http://dwarf-fortress-scenario-picker.herokuapp.com' %> for about 7 or 8 months before I got the idea to make generators for other games as well. Whilst planning out a Minecraft and Crusader Kings 2 generator I realise it would be smarter to just make one system that could host generators for lots of games. A week or two later I bought scenariogenerator.net and launched the new site.

      <div class="col-xs-12 question">Why are you asking for donations?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        I dislike ads, you dislike ads. They are universally reviled and made the site look like shit. I replaced them with a couple donation links in the hopes that fans of the website would help keep the site running and ad-free. So far the generosity of the community has been great. I'd like to thank anyone who has donated and remind them that they can be featured on the <%= link_to 'donator\'s page', '/donators' %> if they want, just shoot me an <%= link_to 'email', 'mailto:daniel@scenariogenerator.net', class: 'faq-email-link' %>.

        Do you take suggestions for games?
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        Yes! Click <%= link_to 'here', '#suggestion-link', class: 'show-suggestion embedded' %> to submit a suggestion. I read every suggestion that is posted and have a long list of requested games that are going to make it onto the site. Unfortunately some games just aren't suited to the format and can't easily be translated into a generator, however most are so don't hesitate to send your suggestion.

      <div class="col-xs-12 question">Can I write my own generator?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        If you want to make your own generator you can definitely do that, either send me an <%= link_to 'email', 'mailto:daniel@scenariogenerator.net', class: 'faq-email-link' %> with the information for the challenge, scenario, or playthrough or take a look at the website's <%= link_to 'github page', 'https://github.com/Lockyy/scenario-generator', class: 'faq-github-link' %> where you can add a game and request to have it added to the site. Unfortunately the documentation for how to write a game isn't great, if you ask me to write up some documentation I'll definitely get around to it however.

        I want to give you my email to get updates. Will you spam me?

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        I will never spam you or share your email address with any third parties. Your email is strictly confidential and I will only send you emails every so often to provide you with updates about the site. I strive to make sure that every email I send out contains at least a few new games since the last email so there'll always be a chance that the game you're waiting for has been added.

        Send me an <%= link_to 'email', 'mailto:daniel@scenariogenerator.net', class: 'faq-email-link' %> or drop it in the suggestion box. I love adding new features and if your suggestion is good I'll definitely include it in the site. So far scenario/character/playthrough saving, item completion marking, and individual column rerolling have all been added due to community requests.

      <div class="col-xs-12 question">Why scenario generator and not challenge generator?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        I can't remember. The original site was just called Dwarf Fortress Scenario Picker, I have no idea why I named it that but Scenario Generator just naturally evolved from that.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">Skyrim and Minecraft get the most traffic. Crusader Kings 2, Pokemon, and Europa Universalis come up just behind them. None of the generators get ignored however, they are all used by fans of their respective games.</div>
